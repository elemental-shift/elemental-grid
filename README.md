#About
The Elemental Grid  System allows for the creation of a flexible grid system without cluttering the html with non semantic markup. It allows you to set the number of columns, column width and the gutter width. 

It is possible to order columns from right-to-left or left-to-right.

It currently only supports [SASS](http://http://sass-lang.com/), however, a LESS implementation is planned.
